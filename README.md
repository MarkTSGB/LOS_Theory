# LOS Theory: Emergent Behavior in Electrical Grids

This is a working theory of **Loss of Signal (LOS)** events in modern power networks — a physics-first exploration of how synchronous grids might self-reform after waveform collapse.

It proposes that under the right conditions, **inertia and excitation memory** can allow reformation *without external control* — and that protection systems may be acting too soon.
